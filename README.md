# An Ai that can do Your Homework

just run the notebook in google colab, otherwise you can't save and load the model (that i know of).

Live version running here: [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hGxYPTx0E515cPcY-_vWfsdHMJQ1hPP8)



This is a compilation of code by Max Woolf and my code to build the SQUAD dataset and use it with GPT-2.

My final loss was `0.06` after `4000` iterations and seems to be able to get contextual references pretty damn well.

### how to use

just like run it but not the cells that aren't super important. If you're building the dataset like I did then you don't need to run the cell that imports it from drive. Even if you just download my version (i have it as a gist) you don't need to run that cell.

you also don't have to run the import model from drive unless you're using a pretrained model. (you can find mine in my medium article, it's pretty bomb)



Thats all.
